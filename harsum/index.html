	    	<p>Problems with the retina present with distortion, blur, or shadows in the vision. Torn or detached retinas are a surgical emergency. A torn retina may cause a ‘shower’ of floaters (retinal tear), a curtain-like peripheral shadow (macula sparing retinal detachment), or loss of vision (macula involving retinal detachment). Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is where the retina becomes thinned (Dry AMD) or swollen (wet AMD). AMD and diabetic retinopathy, are the commonest causes of blindness in the UK. Other causes of retinal damage are blocked veins or arteries.</p>
