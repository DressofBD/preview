A torn retina may cause a ‘shower’ of floaters (retinal tear), a curtain-like peripheral shadow (macula sparing retinal detachment), or loss of vision (macula involving retinal detachment). Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is where the retina becomes thinned (Dry AMD) or swollen (wet AMD). AMD and diabetic retinopathy, are the commonest causes of blindness in the UK. Other causes of retinal damage are blocked veins or arteries.</p>

	    	<p>The eyelids are essential for keeping the eye moist and lubricated. They contain large oil glands known as meibomian glands. Meibomian oil mixes with tears to form a protective tear film. Tear ducts in the upper and lower lids drain excess tears from the eyes to the back of the nose and throat.</p>
	    	<p>The oil glands within the eyelid margins can become inflamed or blocked (blepharitis) causing dry eyes. They can become infected causing a tender lid lump (Stye). The upper lid may droop (ptosis) and obscure the vision or become elevated (retracted) giving a staring appearance. The lids can lose their <a href="#!" target="_blank">elasticity</a>, allowing them to roll inward (entropion) or outward (ectropion). This causes the eye to become red and sore. </p>
