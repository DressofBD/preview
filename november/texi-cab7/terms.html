          <p>Dover Royal Taxis  does not accept any responsibility in any way for missed flights for whatever reason i.e. traffic delays, accidents, breakdowns, severe weather conditions or any unforeseen circumstances.</p>

          <p>We advise passengers to plan to arrive at the airport 2 and a half hours prior to flight departure to allow for possible unpredicted delays en route to or from the airport.  Dover Royal Taxis  will not take responsibility for any passengers missing their flight if two hours check in time was not allowed.</p>

          <p>All passengers are advised to have adequate travel insurance prior to booking.</p>
